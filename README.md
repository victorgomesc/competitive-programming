## 🧠 My Approach to Problem Solving

Solving a problem is not just about getting the right output—it's about **thinking like a computer scientist**. Here's my step-by-step methodology:

1. **Understand the problem** deeply—no shortcuts.
2. **Identify edge cases** and constraints.
3. **Choose the right algorithm** (greedy, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.).
4. **Design clean, testable C# code** using .NET standards.
5. **Refactor and optimize** for elegance and performance.
6. **Document and reflect**—growth comes from understanding _why_.

All solutions aim to be:

- ✅ Correct
- ⚡ Efficient (time and space)
- 📦 Reusable and readable
