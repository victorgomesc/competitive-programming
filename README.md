# 🧠 Competitive Programming in C#

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming** study repository! This space is dedicated to documenting and organizing my learning journey through algorithmic challenges and data structures using the **C# programming language**.

## 💡 What is this repository?

This repository contains my personal solutions to programming problems from various online judges and competitive programming platforms such as:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [URI/Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)
- And others...

## 🧩 How I solve problems

Each problem is solved using **C# (.NET)** and stored in an organized structure by platform and difficulty level.

My approach generally follows these steps:

1. **Read and understand** the problem statement carefully.
2. **Break down the problem** into simpler parts or edge cases.
3. **Choose the right algorithm** (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming, backtracking, etc.).
4. **Write and test** the code using C#.
5. **Optimize** the solution when possible (both in time and space).
6. **Document** the thought process in comments or markdown files when needed.
